The solution is simple: correct the spelling of the class name within the `@apply` directive.

```css
/* Correct usage */
.my-element { @apply bg-blue-500; }
```

Ensure that `bg-blue-500` (or your desired class) is defined in your Tailwind CSS configuration. You might need to purge your CSS or restart your development server to reflect changes in your `tailwind.config.js` file.
